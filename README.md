# hummbl-gpts

Vendor-agnostic, governance-first specifications for HUMMBL custom GPTs and prompt-portable AI interfaces.

This repository defines **portable system prompts, explicit non-claims, and pinned canonical references** for HUMMBL GPT interfaces. Custom GPTs are treated as **optional, non-authoritative UI surfaces** that must work alongside regular ChatGPT usage, Codex (browser / IDE / CLI), and other LLM or agent tools.

## Scope
- Prompt and interface specifications only
- Governance and authority boundaries
- Portability across vendors and execution surfaces

## Non-Goals
- No execution engines
- No validation or enforcement authority
- No platform lock-in
- No canonical definitions (see HUMMBL/Base120 repos)

Authority lives in artifacts and governance, not in any model or UI.

Status: **Initial scaffold**
