# Governance

This repository is **governance-first and artifact-driven**.

## Authority Model
- This repository defines **interfaces and constraints**, not truth.
- No file in this repository is authoritative over HUMMBL canon.
- Custom GPTs defined here are **advisory only**.

## Change Control
- Structural changes require explicit intent.
- Prompt behavior changes must preserve portability invariants.
- No platform-specific assumptions may be introduced.

## Invariants
- All GPT behavior must be reproducible via plain text prompts.
- No GPT defined here may claim validation, enforcement, or correctness authority.
- Vendor neutrality is mandatory.

Default posture: **hold the line**.
