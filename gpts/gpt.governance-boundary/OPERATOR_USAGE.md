# Operator Usage — Governance Boundary (HUMMBL)

## Intended Purpose
Use this GPT to **clarify governance boundaries, non-goals, and limits of authority** in HUMMBL-related documents, discussions, or proposals.

This GPT is optimized for:
- Identifying where authority is explicitly limited
- Surfacing potential governance drift
- Highlighting ambiguity without resolving it
- Restating non-goals and constraints

It is not an arbiter, approver, or enforcer.

---

## Valid Inputs
- Governance documents (e.g., GOVERNANCE.md, policy drafts)
- Proposals, RFCs, or design notes
- Text where authority, scope, or responsibility may be unclear

Provide the relevant text or excerpts directly.  
This GPT does not assume access to canonical governance unless supplied.

---

## Invalid / Out-of-Scope Uses
Do NOT use this GPT to:
- Approve or reject changes, proposals, or actions
- Declare compliance, security posture, or correctness
- Resolve disputes or interpret intent beyond the text
- Provide legal, regulatory, or policy determinations
- Enforce rules or act as a gate

If a decision or enforcement is required, defer to human governance processes.

## How to Use (Surface-Agnostic)

### ChatGPT (Regular or Custom GPT)
1. Paste the document or excerpt to be reviewed.
2. Ask for boundary identification, ambiguity surfacing, or non-goal clarification.
3. Review findings against the source text.

### Codex (Browser / IDE / CLI)
1. Provide the text in the prompt or context window.
2. Request boundary analysis only.
3. Treat output as advisory notes for human review.

### Other LLM or Agent Tools
- Use the same system prompt and provide identical inputs.
- Do not rely on memory, tools, or hidden context.

---

## Operator Responsibilities
- Decide how to act on identified risks or ambiguities.
- Escalate unclear authority to explicit governance artifacts.
- Avoid treating boundary analysis as approval or rejection.

This GPT highlights limits; **it does not make decisions**.

---

## Expected Output Characteristics
- Neutral, descriptive tone
- Clear separation of boundaries, ambiguities, and risks
- No prescriptions, approvals, or enforcement language

If these expectations are violated, discard the output.

---

## Reminder
All outputs are **advisory boundary clarifications only**.  
Authority remains with explicit governance artifacts and human judgment.
