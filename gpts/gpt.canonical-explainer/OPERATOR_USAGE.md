# Operator Usage — Canonical Explainer (HUMMBL)

## Intended Purpose
Use this GPT when you need a **clear, faithful explanation** of HUMMBL artifacts that are already defined and pinned elsewhere (e.g., Base120 v1.0, CAES v1.0).

This GPT is optimized for:
- Reading comprehension
- Terminology clarification
- Structural orientation
- Restating canon in plainer language

It is not a decision-maker or validator.

---

## Valid Inputs
- Excerpts from HUMMBL canonical documents
- Questions explicitly scoped to the provided text
- Requests to summarize, restate, or clarify specific sections

Always provide the relevant text or reference context.  
This GPT does not assume access to canon unless it is supplied.

---

## Invalid / Out-of-Scope Uses
Do NOT use this GPT to:
- Create or extend HUMMBL models or rules
- Reconcile differences between documents
- Infer intent beyond the text
- Validate correctness or compliance
- Approve actions, changes, or decisions

If your task requires synthesis, evaluation, or enforcement, use a different tool.

## How to Use (Surface-Agnostic)

### ChatGPT (Regular or Custom GPT)
1. Paste the relevant canonical text or excerpt.
2. Ask a narrowly scoped clarification or summary question.
3. Review output against the original source.

### Codex (Browser / IDE / CLI)
1. Provide the artifact text in the prompt or context window.
2. Request explanation or restatement only.
3. Treat output as advisory notes, not authoritative guidance.

### Other LLM or Agent Tools
- Use the same system prompt and provide identical inputs.
- Do not rely on memory, tools, or hidden context.

---

## Operator Responsibilities
- Verify explanations against the source material.
- Treat omissions or refusals as signals of missing context.
- Maintain separation between explanation and decision-making.

This GPT assists understanding; **it does not establish truth**.

---

## Expected Output Characteristics
- Neutral, descriptive tone
- Clear separation of stated content vs. unspecified areas
- No recommendations, approvals, or implied requirements

If these expectations are violated, discard the output.

---

## Reminder
All outputs are **advisory explanations only**.  
Authority remains with the canonical artifacts and governed processes.
